This works by counting how many instances of each integer exist in the input
and using those to build two integers.

We maximize the value of these integers by putting the biggest ones the furthest
to the left possible.

Counting digits is complexity O(n) and creating the integers O(n) also. So the
overall complexity of the script is O(n) also.

Space complexity is O(n) assuming that we accept only integers with one digit: we
will always just need an array with capacity for 10 integers ( 0 to 9)
